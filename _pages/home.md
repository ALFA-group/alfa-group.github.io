Our goal is to computationally replicate Adversarial Intelligence: the intent, strategy, and tactics that are featured when adversaries compete and learn.

### Diversity Drives Innovation and Learning

At the Anyscale Learning For All (ALFA) Group, we mean Anyscale Learning for ALL. ALFA is dedicated to cultivating an inclusive culture that supports, promotes, and empowers diverse voices in Computer Science & AI. Our focus is to improve and build machine learning, AI, and data analytics technology that works for everyone.

Representation matters.

We want our research to be representative of everyone who benefits and learns from it. We value people with different experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds - itâ€™s the cornerstone of our approach to learning and research. We celebrate diversity along many axes: race, religion, ethnicity, age, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, genetic disposition, neurodiversity, disability, veteran status and any other aspect which makes you unique.


### Sponsors
ALFA's research would not be possible without the past and ongoing support of our industry sponsors
